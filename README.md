TOP PROJECT:Recipes

The objective of the project is to create a simple recipe website that displays the skills that I have learnt from the TOP online course.

Skills required to create this project are -
* Basic GIT knowledge, such as git add/commit/pull
* Basic HTML knowledge, to incorporate hyperlinks, images and lists

All recipes were shamelessly stolen from my Mother.
